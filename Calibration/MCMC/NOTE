This implementation uses Keith O'Haras MCMC library for C++.
https://www.kthohr.com/mcmclib.html

However one has to make a modification to the source code to make it work (the target log kernel needs to be passed what chain index it is called by since we use pre-allocated working space for the model run (the inca_data_set)).

This makes installation of the MCMC package nontrivial, as I don't want to upload the modified source code.

For now I have not decided what to do about this or whether we want to keep using that library.

Also, the functionality of setting up an MCMC run for INCA right now is pretty rudimentary. It is not complete by any means.
