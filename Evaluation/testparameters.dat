"Manning's coefficient" :     #(s/(m^1/3)) [0.012, 0.1] Default of 0.04 is for clean winding natural channels. See e.g. Chow 1959 for a table of values for other channel types

###################### "Reaches" ######################
"Catchment area" :     #(km^2) [0, 10000]
51.7

"Reach length" :     #(m) [0, 10000000] This is divided by two for headwater reaches in the model to calculate the average reach length travelled by water. If this is inappropriate for your headwater reach, adjust this parameter accordingly
