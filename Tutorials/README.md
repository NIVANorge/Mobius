# Tutorials

Here are three tutorials that you can use to learn the very basics of building models with Mobius. The best way to follow the tutorials is:
- Read the various files, then compile and run the tutorial and see if the output was what you expected. You have to run them from the command line.
- Try to understand all the comments in the files.
- Modify the files, then **recompile** and run and see if the output is what you expected.

More detailed documentation can e.g. be found in the [Model builder documentation](https://github.com/NIVANorge/Mobius/blob/master/Documentation/model_builder_documentation.pdf), but it is strongly recommended that you try the tutorials instead of just reading the documentation.
After following these three tutorials, you can also see if you can understand the more complex models found in the Modules folder.


### Tutorial1
Learn the very basics of setting up a Model, registering parameters and equations with it, and running it with a dataset.

### Tutorial2
More advanced index set structure. Multiple equations. File organization. Parameter and input files.

### Tutorial3
A full toy model. ODE equations and solvers. Explicit indexing. How to set up your model to work with MobiView (or the python wrapper).
