#The next line says that this input set contains 20 values for each of its input series. This means that it could be used with a model run that lasts up to 20 timesteps (but the model could be run for a shorter amount of timesteps if wanted). Note that it is important that there actually are 20 values provided for X below. If there are multiple input series, they all have to have the same amount of timesteps (at least for now).
