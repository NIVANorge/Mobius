# Documentation

The documentation is being written. 
We welcome feedback on the documentation in order to make it more useful.

### Mostly finished:
**file_format_documentation** - The parameter and input file formats.
**model_builder_documentation** - For people who want to build new models using the framework.

### Planned:
**model_user_documentation** - For people who want to use existing models, typically packaged in INCAView-compatible exes.
**framework_developer_documentation** - Not exhaustive, but to give a good overview of how the framework works internally for people who want to extend on it. How some of the core algorithms and data organization works.

### Maybe:
Documentation of individual models. However this is time consuming. Many of these models are published in articles, and you can combine reading those with reading the model source code (under the Modules folder). The source code is often very readable and self-documenting in the choice of variable names.
