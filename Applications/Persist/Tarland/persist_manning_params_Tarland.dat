###################### Solver resolution {no index sets} ######################

"Solver resolution" :     #(dimensionless) [0.001, 0.5] Default should be 0.1, decrease this if the reach hydrology misbehaves. This should only be necessary if you have reaches shorter than about 1km
0.1


###################### Hydrology by land class {"Landscape units"} ######################

"Snow multiplier" :     #(dimensionless) [0.5, 1.5] Adjustment factor used to account for bias in the relationship between snow measured in the gauge and effective snowfall amounts falling
1

"Snow melt temperature" :     #(°C) [-4, 4] The temperature at or above which snow can melt
0

"Degree day melt factor" :     #(mm/°C/day) [1, 4] Describes the dependency of snow melt rates on temperature. The parameter represents the number of millimetres water melted per degree celcius above the snow melt temperature
3

"Rain multiplier" :     #(dimensionless) [0.5, 1.5] Adjustment factor used to account for bias in the relationship between rain measured in the gauge and effective rainfall amounts falling
1

"Initial snow depth" :     #(mm SWE) [0, 9999] The depth of snow, expressed as water equivalents, at the start of the simulation
0

"Degree day evapotranspiration" :     #(mm/°C/day) [0.05, 0.2] Describes the baseline dependency of evapotranspiration on air temperature. The parameter represents the number of millimetres water evapotranspired per degree celcius above the growing degree threshold when evapotranspiration rates are not soil moisture limited
0.2

"Growing degree threshold" :     #(°C) [-4, 4] The temperature at or above which plant growth and hence evapotranspiration are assumed to occur
-1

"Canopy interception" :     #(mm/day) [0, 0.3] The depth of precipitation which does not make it to the soil surface but is instead intercepted by the vegetative canopy and returned to the atmosphere either through evaporation or sublimation
0
