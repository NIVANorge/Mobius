	# Erodibility and sediments (no index sets) #

	# Phosphorous (no index sets) #

	"Dynamic soil water EPC0, TDP and soil labile P" :     # Calculate a dynamic soil water EPC0 (the equilibrium P concentration of zero sorption), and therefore soilwater TDP concentration, so that it varies with labile P content? The labile P will also therefore vary
	true

	"Run in calibration mode" :     # Run model in calibration mode? If true, the initial agricultural soil water TDP concentration (and therefore EPC0) is calibrated and used to estimate the phosphorus sorption coefficient. If false, the sorption coefficient is read in from the parameter file
	true

	"Soil mass per m2" :     #(kg/m^2) [0, 200] Estimate as topsoil depth * bulk density. Used to estimate the initial mass of labile soil P. Mostly important if you are interested in longer-term changes in soil P content
	95

	"Phosphorous sorption coefficient" :     #(l/mg) [0, 0.1] Gradient of linear relationship between labile P and TDP concentration. This value is only used if calibration run mode is set to false, otherwise it is estimated by the model

	0.7


	# Phosphorous reach ("Reaches") #

	"Groundwater TDP concentration" :     #(mg/l) [0, 10] Groundwater TDP concentration is constant through the model run. For small catchments, we recommend keeping this constant across sub-catchments
	0.02

	"Reach effluent TDP inputs" :     #(kg/day) [0, 10] These are EFFECTIVE inputs, i.e. immediate instream removal proportion * raw measured inputs. We do not include the removal fraction as a separate parameter as it would be linearly correlated with the sewage input parameter in uncertainty analysis

	"Initial soil water TDP concentration and EPC0" :     #(mg/l) [0, 10] Recommend setting this to 0 for semi-natural (or low soil P) land, and just providing a value for agricultural (or high soil P land). If the dynamic soil P option is set to false, this value is the soil water TDP concentration throughout the model run
	0.1 0.1 0

	"Initial total soil P content" :     #(mg/kg) [0, 10000] 
	1458 1458 873

	"Inactive soil P content" :     #(mg/kg) [0, 10000] For both semi-natural (or low-P) and agricultural (high-P) land, we recommend using the initial total soil P content of semi-natural (or low-P land), unless the soil types are very different
