# MAGIC

This is an adaptation of the MAGIC model (The Model of Acidification of Groundwater In Catchments)

The original canonical implementation was done in FORTRAN by B.J.Cosby. This is a translation of the model using the Mobius framework.

The core of the model works, but advanced nitrogen dynamics or lake stratification are currently not implemented.
