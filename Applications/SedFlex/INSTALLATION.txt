SedFlex depends on the armadillo C++ linear algebra library
http://arma.sourceforge.net/
Which again depends on openBLAS

The following instructions are for 64bit Windows. Other platforms are not yet tested.

To compile SedFlex, you need to download armadillo from here:
http://arma.sourceforge.net/download.html
Then put the contents of the include directory (inside the download) in the include directory of your compiler

Next, you need to copy the folder (not just its contents)
examples/lib_win64
to this SedFlex folder, so that the file SedFlex/lib_win64/libopenblas.lib exists.

To run SedFlex, you also need to copy lib_win64/libopenblas.dll to the same folder as your running .exe (this is typically MobiView.exe).
