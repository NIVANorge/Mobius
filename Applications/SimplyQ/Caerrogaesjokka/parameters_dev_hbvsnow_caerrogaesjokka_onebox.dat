	"Quick flow rate inflection point" :     #(mm/day) [1, 200] Quick flow scales to the combined input of rainfall and snow melt, but the proportion flattens out towards 1 near the inflection point.

	229.132973205987

	"Manning's coefficient" :     #(s/(m^1/3)) [0.012, 0.1] Default of 0.04 is for clean winding natural channels. See e.g. Chow 1959 for a table of values for other channel types
	0.04

	0.014


	# Hydrology subcatchment/reach ("Reaches") #

	"Initial in-stream flow" :     #(m^3/s) [0, 1000000] This parameter is only used by reaches that don't have other reaches as inputs.

	"Soil water time constant" :     #(days) [0.01, 40] 
	7.08875108976202
