	# Hydrology (no index sets) #

	"Quick flow rate inflection point" :     #(mm/day) [1, 200] Quick flow scales to the combined input of rainfall and snow melt, but the proportion flattens out towards 1 near the inflection point.
	60

	"Quick flow dryness limit" :     #(dimensionless) [0, 1] At what fraction of field capacity quick flow stops
	0.95

	"Soil field capacity" :     #(mm) [0, 1000] 
	290

	"Baseflow index" :     #(dimensionless) [0, 1] 
	0.725617970057511

	"Groundwater time constant" :     #(days) [0.5, 400] 
	42.0212181491907

	"Manning's coefficient" :     #(s/(m^1/3)) [0.012, 0.1] Default of 0.04 is for clean winding natural channels. See e.g. Chow 1959 for a table of values for other channel types
	0.04


	# General subcatchment and reach parameters ("Reaches") #

	"Catchment area" :     #(km^2) [0, 10000]
	51.7

	"Reach length" :     #(m) [0, 10000000] This is divided by two for headwater reaches in the model to calculate the average reach length travelled by water. If this is inappropriate for your headwater reach, adjust this parameter accordingly
	10000

	"Reach slope" :     #(m/m) [1e-05, 3]
	0.014


	# Hydrology subcatchment/reach ("Reaches") #

	"Initial in-stream flow" :     #(m^3/s) [0, 1000000] This parameter is only used by reaches that don't have other reaches as inputs.
	1


	# Hydrology land ("Landscape units") #

	"Soil water time constant" :     #(days) [0.01, 40] 
	2


	# Land cover ("Reaches" "Landscape units") #

	"Land use proportions" :     #(dimensionless) [0, 1] Must sum to 1 over the landscape units for each given reach.
