	"Temperature below which precipitation falls as snow" :     #(°C) [-4, 4]
	0

	"Temperature above which snow melts" :     #(°C) [-4, 4]
	0

	"Degree-day factor for snow melt" :     #(mm/°C/day) [0, 5] 
	2.74

	"Liquid water fraction" :     #(dimensionless) [0, 1] Amount of melt water each unit of snow can hold before it is released
	0.1

	"Refreeze efficiency" :     #(dimensionless) [0, 1]
	0.5

	"Snow distribution coefficient of variation" :     #(dimensionless) [0, 1] 0 gives even snow distribution among boxes, 1 or higher gives a very skew distribution.

	# Hydrology (no index sets) #

	"Quick flow rate inflection point" :     #(mm/day) [1, 200] Quick flow scales to the combined input of rainfall and snow melt, but the proportion flattens out towards 1 near the inflection point.

	42.0212181491907

	"Manning's coefficient" :     #(s/(m^1/3)) [0.012, 0.1] Default of 0.04 is for clean winding natural channels. See e.g. Chow 1959 for a table of values for other channel types
	0.04

	0.014


	# Hydrology subcatchment/reach ("Reaches") #

	"Initial in-stream flow" :     #(m^3/s) [0, 1000000] This parameter is only used by reaches that don't have other reaches as inputs.

	# Hydrology land ("Landscape units") #

	"Soil water time constant" :     #(days) [0.01, 40] 
	2


	# Land cover ("Reaches" "Landscape units") #
