# SimplyC

This folder contains an application of a first prototype version of SimplyC, a simple model to simulate daily in-stream DOC concentrations and fluxes, which uses SimplyQ as its hydrology model. The model is currently under development.

The scientific motivation behind the development of SimplyC is similar to that for SimplyP, which are briefly outlined in the [SimplyP readme](https://github.com/NIVANorge/Mobius/tree/master/Applications/SimplyP#simplyp-mobius-version), and references contained within that folder. The SimplyC folder contents are also similar to the contents of the Applications/SimplyP folder, which is also described in the SimplyP readme.

Contributions to SimplyC development and testing are welcome.
