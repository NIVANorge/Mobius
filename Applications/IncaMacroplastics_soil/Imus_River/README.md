From "Modelling macroplastic fluxes in the Imus catchment: Impacts of long-term accumulation and extreme events" (Clayer et al.)

Files include: input and parameter files for IncaMacroplastics following two scenarios (default and Remediation2006) as well as two calibrations (LandAcc and RiverAcc). 
The two pythons scripts used to perform the Monte Carlo sensitivity analyses are also included.
