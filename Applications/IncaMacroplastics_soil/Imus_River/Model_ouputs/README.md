# Model outputs from IncaMacroplastics applied to Imus River Catchment 
In each folder, 1990-2020 timeseries of output variables are stored in comma delimited files (*.dat). 
An ensemble of 2400 to 3000 runs was performed for each calibration ("LandAcc" or "RiverAcc") and scenario ("default" or "Remediation2006") combination
as described in the manuscript "Modelling macroplastic fluxes in the Imus catchment: Impacts of long-term accumulation and extreme events" (Clayer et al.).

The "dates.dat" file contains a single column of dates while the other files contains 2400 to 3000 columns (one for each run).
The output variables are given in the name of the files, as well as the units:
- "Water_Discharge_m3_s.dat"
- "Buried_Plastics_on_land_Kg.dat"
- "Total_Plastics_on_land_Free_and_Buried_Kg.dat"
- "Plastics_on_RiverBank_Kg.dat"
- "Plastics_in_RiverVegetation_Kg.dat"
- "Plastics_exported_to_Sea_KgPerDay.dat"
