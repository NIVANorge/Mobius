# Application of MAGIC to Langtjern with future scenarios of deposition and climate change

We used MAGIC to simulate water chemistry from 1860 to 2100 using historical and projected deposition and climate. 
New in this application of MAGIC on Langtjern is 
  i) a solubility control of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from S deposition, which allows inclusion of the changing role of organic acids in chemical recovery
  ii) user-defined changes in weathering rates.
