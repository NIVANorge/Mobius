# R wrapper

This is a wrapper for Mobius to R using Rcpp. So far this has far fewer features than the Python wrapper, but we may extend it a little more in the future.

How to use:
You have to install the Rcpp library in R using e.g. 
`install.packages('Rcpp')`

You also need Rtools: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/
It is probably the safest to get the latest stable version.
**It is important that you check the box allowing the installer to modify your PATH variable**

We will come back with more examples on how to set this up with a new model and run it from an R script. For now, see the files in this folder.

Thanks to Simon Woodward for some good ideas on how to set this up.
